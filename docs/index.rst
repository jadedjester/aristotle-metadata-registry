Welcome to Aristotle MetaData Registry's documentation!
=======================================================

Aristotle-MDR is an open-source metadata registry as laid out by the requirements
of the `ISO/IEC 11179:2013 specification <http://metadata-standards.org/11179/>`_.

Aristotle-MDR represents a new way to manage and federate content built on and extending
the principles of leading metadata registry. The code of Aristotle is completely open-source,
building on the Django web framework and the mature model of the 11179 standard,
agencies can easily run their own metadata registries while also having the ability
to extend the information model and tap into the permissions and roles of ISO 11179.

By allowing organisations to run their own independant registries they are able to
expose authoritative metadata and the governance processes behind its creation,
and building upon known and open systems agencies, can build upon a stable platform
or the sharing of 11179 metadata items.

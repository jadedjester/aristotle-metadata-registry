Extending Aristotle-MDR
=======================

One of the core features of the ISO/IEC 11179-3 information model is the ability
to extend the models by subclassing from the included items. The core item that
most 11179 objects are based on is the "Concept".

Due to this encouragement of inheritance and enhancement, Aristotle-MDR follows
similar principles and using the Object-Oriented approach of
`Python <https://www.python.org/>`_ and `Django <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`_,
provides a large capability to extend and improve

Before starting it is strongly encouraged that you have a clear understanding of
the `Python programming language <https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/>`_ as well as
`how to build Django apps and sites <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/intro/tutorial01/>`_.

<h2>Using the superseding relationship</h2>
<p>All <a href="{% url 'aristotle:about' 'administered_items' %}">administered Items</a>, such as Data Elements or Object Classes
have the ability to indicate a formal relationship to other items which supersede
</p>
<div class="panel panel-warning">
    <div class="panel-heading">
        <i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> Always check relationships are valid
    </div>
    <div class="panel-body">
        It is possible for an editor to create two items that each indicates they supersede the other,
        leading to a circular relationship.
        <br>While Aristotle is able to handle content created in this way
        without breaking, a situation like this would not be semantically correct.

<h2>Using the <tt>version</tt> attribute</h2>
<p>Administered items can also be given a version marker.
This can be a maximum of 20 characters long, with any form of number, letters and punctation.
An agency or registration authority should have clear rules around what make a "valid" version marker.
</p>

<div class="panel panel-success">
    <div class="panel-heading">
        <i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> Versioning, superseding and standardisation go hand in hand.
    </div>
    <div class="panel-body">
        Version markers should <em>not</em> replace superseding items and the standisation process.
        Once an item has been made standard it should rarely need to be changed.
        <br>If a new version of an item is to be created, this can be achieved by creating a new item, with an updated version.
        Once the new item is standardised, these two items can then be semantically linked via the superseding option.
